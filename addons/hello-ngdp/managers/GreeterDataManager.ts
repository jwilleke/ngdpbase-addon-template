/**
 * GreeterDataManager — data layer for the hello-ngdp addon.
 *
 * Registered on the engine as 'GreeterDataManager' during register(), so other
 * addons and plugins reach it with engine.getManager('GreeterDataManager').
 *
 * Note what the constructor does NOT take: a way to reach the network of its
 * own. `fetchJson` is injected by register(), built there on the host's guarded
 * fetch under the instance's egress policy. An addon that calls bare `fetch`
 * bypasses that policy completely, so the manager is handed the one door it is
 * allowed to use rather than being trusted to pick the right one (#1133).
